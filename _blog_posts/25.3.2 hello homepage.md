Well, OK. This is the first post and I have to say the **CHATGPT** took on most of the homepage construction task, including the following decription of the first edition of my homepage! ðŸ¤£ But I can see some problems in its description, just let it be like this. ðŸ«¡ to CHATGPT.

Hello Web World! Today, we're diving into the basics of constructing a simple yet dynamic homepage using Jekyll, focusing on four key sections: Works, Experience, Awards, and Blog Posts. Here's a brief overview of how to set up and configure each section in your home.html.

1. Works
This section displays a list of projects or works. The attributes typically include:

Title: The name of the project.
Date: When the project was completed or released.
Description: A brief summary of the project.
2. Experience
Here, you list your professional experiences. Common attributes are:

Title: Job title or role.
Location: Where you worked.
Date Start and Date End: The duration of your employment.
Details: A brief description of your responsibilities and achievements.
3. Awards
This section showcases any recognitions or awards you've received. Attributes include:

Title: The name of the award.
Organization: The entity that awarded it.
Receive Date: When you received the award.
4. Blog Posts
This is a list of recent blog entries. Attributes for each post might be:

Title: The title of the blog post.
Date: The publication date.
Summary: A short summary or teaser of the blog content.
Construction Process
To construct home.html with these sections in Jekyll:

Define Collections: In _config.yml, define each collection (works, experience, awards, blog_posts) to manage their respective data.

Create Content Files: Populate each collection with markdown files containing the necessary metadata and content.

Develop the Layout: Use HTML and Liquid templating in home.html to iterate over each collection and display its items.

Style the Page: Apply CSS to style the layout, ensuring that each section is visually distinct and appealing.

This setup allows you to maintain a clean and organized homepage where updates to your works, experiences, awards, or blog posts are automatically reflected on your site through Jekyll's build process.
