I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the course "Introduction to Computer Systems" (CSAPP) during the first semester of my junior year at Peking University. I was responsible for managing assignments, exams, lab deployment, and conducting some of the course teachings. My instructor was [Youwei Zhuo](https://ic.pku.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/sjzdhyjsxtx1/zyw/index.htm).
