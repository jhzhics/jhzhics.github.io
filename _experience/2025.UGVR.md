In [UGVR program](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/global-engineering-programs/undergraduate-visiting-research-program), I worked with Prof. [Keith Winstein](https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw/) to build an innovative CS intro course *[Codilon](https://github.com/codillon)*. My [final poster](assets/experience/2025.UGVR/Jiahao Poster- JET V1.pdf) and [talk](assets/experience/2025.UGVR/JET Talk V3.pptx) is about the web framework *JET* we built for *codilon*. *JET* is a typesafe web framework for Guaranteed Consistency 
and Fine-Grained Rendering.
